    <h3>Hobby</h3>
     <hr>
     <p>Some of my hobbies are going outside and rding my bike, going on a nature walk and finding millions of little worms along the way, and reading a good book. Sometimes, I also like to craft. Sometimes I like to think of an idea that I heard, and make something new out of it. Suppose I wanted to make a paper doll, since I didn't have enough fabric. I could try to think of an idea to make each part. I try to make my thiking very simple, because if you ever tried... your brain practically explodes after a while. I guess you could create a Google Slide or Doc to keep yourself organized, but personally all I do is keep the steps really simple. I base the steps on a certain topic and store the steps in my brain. Where exactly? I don't know. It just stores somewhere. But sometimes I do forget some of the steps. Like one time I was doing something one day, and the day before I thought I was going to try something out. But then for whatever reason there had to be this concept of forgetting things, and I was already in bed by the time I thought I was going to do it. Yeah, it's really annoying when that happens. But after a few days of forgetting, I just remember. Crazy, right? I also got the latest and greatest technology of the company called Nintendo. The Nintendo Switch. Nintendo is a company that makes gaming consoles and games for the consoles. Most people are familiar with the character Mario these days. Mario is a character who goes in dangerous places. He looks like a completely normal person though. I wonder how he does all those really cool looking jumps and spins in the air in "Super Mario 3D World". But I got the game that has been realeased in 2019 recently. It's a game called "Animal Crossing: New Horizons". It's a game that you have to live on a deserted island. This might sound scary for some, but when you see images on the Internet... you will see why so many people like this game. After you play for like a year, which I have not, your island may look like a small town. It's pretty cool how something so rugged, could become looking like the city of Chicago, Illinois. Well maybe not exactly like that, but you get the idea. There are many other versions of this game, such as "Animal Crossing: New Leaf" But this game is played on something called a Nintendo 3DS. So in order to play "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" you need to have a Nintendo Switch. But don't worry! If you want to play, order it during Thankgiving. Typically there is something called the "Black Friday Sale". It's a huge sale on mostly everything you can think of. If you get a Nintendo Switch then, you can have a extra bonus game. Awesome right!</p>
